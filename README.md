# Compose <-> terminal.shop

This is a demo of the terminal.shop admin tools built with Compose. It was built in a morning by [Atul](https://x.com/atooooool).

## How to run

You can run this demo yourself in less than 3 minutes.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a free account on [Compose](https://app.composehq.com/auth/signup) to get an API key.
4. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` in the `src/index.ts` file with your API key.
5. Run `npm run dev`
6. Refresh the [Compose homepage](https://app.composehq.com/home) and you should see the app! Click on it to open.

## Disclaimer

The demo is based on terminal.shop's tools in their [repo](https://github.com/terminaldotshop/terminal/tree/dev/packages/interval/src/routes).

The demo is not 1-1 with the terminal.shop admin tools and takes quite a few liberties with fake data, but it gets the point across.
